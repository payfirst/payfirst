## 🧩 Wallet Architecture

Payfirst wallets are smart, non-custodial, and powered by **Coinbase CDP Infrastructure**.  

✅ Created with passkeys (FaceID, TouchID, or device PIN)  
✅ Private keys never leave your device  
✅ Built on ERC-4337  
✅ Withdraw anytime — Payfirst never holds your funds

---

## 🔑 Passkey Authentication

Passkeys replace traditional passwords with biometric verification and secure key pairs.

- Private key stored locally, never shared  
- Public key verifies your identity  
- Phishing-resistant, device-bound, and secure by design

---

## ⚙️ x402 Protocol

The **x402 protocol** extends HTTP with native payment support, enabling AI agents and automated systems to discover and pay for content programmatically.

**Example Response:**
HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
X-Payment-Required: 2.99 USDC
X-Payment-Address: 0x743bc656C34a532952a35b44b69e795f5f0bDEb
X-Payment-Network: bnb-chain
X-Payment-Memo: paywall-abc123
